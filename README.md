# About me

Hello, my name is Tran Tuan Duc, a Front-End developer with diverse experience in web technologies. I have deep expertise in VueJS and NuxtJS, two popular frameworks for building client-side user interfaces. By applying the core concepts of VueJS and NuxtJS, I can create flexible, interactive, and efficient web applications.

In addition, I have a strong command of CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap and TailwindCSS. I have utilized them to design appealing interfaces that meet user requirements and deliver the best user experience. I understand how to leverage CSS classes, components, and other features of both frameworks to build adaptable and customizable interfaces.

Furthermore, I have experience in converting designs from Figma to Bootstrap. I possess the ability to analyze and implement interface designs from Figma files or other design tools into the HTML and CSS structure of Bootstrap. This enables me to build precise interfaces that accurately represent the original design concepts.

With my knowledge and experience, I am confident in contributing to web development projects. I am constantly learning and improving my skills to stay up-to-date with the latest requirements and trends in the web technology industry.

I am highly enthusiastic and ready to collaborate with colleagues to create outstanding interfaces and deliver memorable user experiences.
